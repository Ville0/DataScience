\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  You have \alert{already experienced} it in \alert{several forms}
\item
  It has been behind resolving some of our common daily tasks for
  several years
\item
  Most of the scientific methods used in data science are not new
\item
  Statistics an old science Simon Laplace 1749 and Thomas Bayes (1701)
\item
  Machine learning relatively new but considered well established
\item
  Computer Science changed lives several decades ago

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\tightlist
\item
  Datafication: disruptive change in our society caused by the evolution
  of technology
\item
  personal level: list of books, films, food, physical activity,
  purchases
\item
  business level: web activity, network activity, machinery signals
\item
  democratization of data analysis
\item
  large companies Google, Yahoo, IBM, SAS were only players when data
  science had no name
\item
  today the gap between companies and people is shrinking.
\item
  access to cloud computing allows any individual to analyze huge
  amounts of data in short periods of time.

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \tightlist
  \item
    Analytical knowledge is free
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Crucial algorithms needed can be found
\item
  Open source development is the norm
