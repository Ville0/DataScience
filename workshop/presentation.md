# What is Data Science?

> - You have \alert{already experienced} it in \alert{several forms}
> - It has been \alert{behind resolving} some of our \alert{common daily tasks for several years}
> - \alert{Most} of the \alert{scientific methods used} in DS are \alert{not new}
> - \alert{Statistics} an old science Simon Laplace 1749 and Thomas Bayes (1701)
> - \alert{Machine learning} relatively new but considered well established
> - \alert{Computer Science} changed lives several decades ago

# Why Data Science is seen as a novel trend?
> - \alert{Datafication}: disruptive change in our society caused by the evolution of technology
> + personal level: list of books, films, food, physical activity, purchases
> + business level: web activity, network activity, machinery signals
> - \alert{democratization of data analysis}
> + large companies Google, Yahoo, IBM, SAS were only players when data science had no name
> + today the gap between companies and people is shrinking.
> - access to cloud computing allows any individual to analyze huge amounts of data in short periods of time.
>	- Analytical knowledge is free 
> + Crucial algorithms needed can be found
> + Open source development is the norm

# Data Science defined
 A methodology by which actionable insights can be inferred from data.

# Objective of data science
- production of beliefs informed by data to be used as the basis of decision making
- In absence of data, beliefs are uninformed and decisions are based on best practice or intuition.

# Data Science and 4 strategies
- DS allow us to adopt 4 different strategies to explore the world using data.
1. Probing reality
2. Pattern discovery
3. Predicting future events
4. Understanding people and the world.

# Probing Reality
- Data can be gathered by
	i) passive methods
	ii) active methods: response of the world to our actions
- Analysis of these responses can be extremely valuable. 
  - e.g. what is the best button size and color? best answer found by probing the world.

# Pattern discovery
- Datafied problems can be analyzed automatically to discover useful patterns.
	- e.g. user profiles an ingredient in programmatic advertising or digital marketing.

# Predicting future events
- variety of statistical techniques that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future events.

# Understanding people and the world
- large companies and governments are investing considerable amounts of money in research areas e.g.
  + understanding natural language
	- computer vision
	- psychology
	- neuroscience
