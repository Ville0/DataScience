# Causality and Experiments

Does the death penalty have a deterrent effect?
Is chocolate good for you?
What causes breast cancer?

- All of these questions attempt to assign a **cause** to an **effect**. 
- A **careful examination of data** can help shed light on questions like these?

## concepts involved in establishing causality

- Observation: is key to good science.
- In observational study scientists make conclusions based on observed data.
- In data science, many studies involve:
	1. **observations on a group of individuals(people)**, 
	2. a factor of interest called a **treatment**, and
	3. an **outcome** measured on each individual.

**Example:** In a study of whether chocolate is good for health
1. the individuals would be people
2. the treatment would be eating chocolate, and
3. the outcome might be a measure of heart disease.

- The **fundamental question** is whether the **treatment** has an effect on the **outcome**.
